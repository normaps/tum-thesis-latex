I would like to express my deepest gratitude to my supervisor Prof. Dr. Gudrun Klinker for providing me with the opportunity to work on such an interesting topic. 
I also want to thank my advisor Chloe Eghtebas for her thoughtful advice and support. 
I am really grateful for her willingness to meet with her students regularly, her time to help me 
when it feels like a dead end and her insightful feedback. 
I am also grateful to my family and friends for their continuous support and love throughout my studies.
